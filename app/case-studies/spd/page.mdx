  Being one of the leading manpower agencies means being able to provide best in class service and providing speedy replies to your client’s request. This would mean that the service response teams would need to have all of the data of the accounts that they manage at their fingertips.

  <br />

  To keep up with the ever growing list of clients, 2 databases have been deployed along with an in-house developed ERP system to help increase productivity, standardize data entry and future proof the company as the company continues to scale upwards.

  <br />

  As the client base grew over the years, so did the data being entered into the 2 databases. Furthermore, the fast evolving manpower landscape in the Philippines, it became harder to sift through 2 huge databases to get the answers that SPD needed from the reports baked into the ERP system.

  <br />

  The question was now, how do we speed up the process of getting to the data that we need to maintain the edge that we possess?

  <br />

  Upon discovering EdgeSet, the answer became clear, consolidating our databases into a single pane of glass and gaining the ability to query between them as if they were one database. This would enable the development team to quickly react to the requests of the service response teams to pull out data to provide clients with the metrics that they require, fast.

  <br />

    <h2 className="text-3xl font-normal leading-9 mb-3 text-edgeset">“Having all the data at your fingertips is like having super powers!” </h2>

   <br />

  The development team can now easily pull data and visualize it to give decision makers an easy to digest overview of the entire organization so that would help speed up the decision making process.

  <br />

  With service response and data visualization addressed, SPD can now also look deeper into their data to enhance other areas in their business.

  <br />

  All this while also still using the same ERP to enter data and the same databases to store them, saving on server upgrade costs and development costs to upgrade the ERP system.
